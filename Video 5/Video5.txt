We understood a bit of collision, adding rigidbody component and physic material.
Collision will be done again in more depth.

Physic material - for bouncy effect
rigidbody - for giving gravity(physics)
collider - to detect collision between two game objects like a cube and plane and make the cube stop when it hits ground.
cube having collider - box collider (shape like a box)
capsule having collider - capsule collider (shape like a capsule)
plane having collider - Mesh collider (shape is like a 2d plane)
